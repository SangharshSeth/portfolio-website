`How to get over saying "It works on my machine"`

## Setup
- We will use a NestJS project which servers simple REST APIs, It uses MySQL for database, redis for queue. We will use docker to first create a image of this application with all the services included in it.

## Create a Dockerfile

```
FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR /app

RUN corepack enable

COPY pnpm-lock.yaml package.json ./

RUN pnpm install

COPY --chown=node:node . .

USER node

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["pnpm", "run", "start:dev"]
```

## Dockerfile Explanation

### `FROM node:alpine`
- Uses the official Node.js image based on Alpine Linux, a lightweight distribution that results in a smaller Docker image.

### `WORKDIR /app`
- Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`, where all subsequent commands will be executed.

### `RUN corepack enable`
- Enables Corepack, which provides support for package managers like `pnpm` in the Node.js environment.
- **Alternatively**: `RUN npm install -g pnpm; RUN pnpm install`.

### `COPY pnpm-lock.yaml package.json ./`
- Copies the `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `package.json` files to the working directory in the container to cache dependencies and speed up builds.

### `RUN pnpm install`
- Installs project dependencies using `pnpm`.

### `COPY --chown=node:node . .`
- Copies the rest of the application code to the working directory, setting ownership to the `node` user for security.

### `USER node`
- Switches the container to run as the `node` user instead of root, enhancing security.

### `EXPOSE 3000`
- Exposes port `3000` on the container, where the application will listen for incoming requests.

### `CMD ["pnpm", "run", "start:dev"]`
- Starts the development server.

## Create a docker-compose file to spin up all the dependencies

```
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql
    container_name: mysql-nestjs
    ports:
      - 3306:3306
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=development
    volumes:
      - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql
  
  nestjs-app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: nestjs-api-service
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=mysql
      - DB_PORT=3306
      - DB_USERNAME=root
      - DB_PASSWORD=root
      - DB_DATABASE=development
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    depends_on:
      - mysql
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules

volumes:
  mysql_data:
  ```
